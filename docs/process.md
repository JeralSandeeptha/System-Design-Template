# The Design Process

<br />

## Requirements Analysis
- Understand `functional` and `non-functional` requirements

<br />

## Cost Estimation and Planning
- Identify constraints and assumptions
- Cost estimation transforms architectural decisions into business realities. It bridges technical design with budget constraints, resource allocation, and project viability

<br />

## Architectures Design
- Choose architectural pattern
- Define major components and their interactions
- Consider `scalability`, `reliability`, and `maintainability`

<br />

## Component Design
- Break down into smaller, manageable modules
- Define interfaces and contracts
- Consider data flow and state management
 
<br />

## Database Design
- Schema design
- Data modeling (relational, document, graph, etc.)
- Consider queries, indexes, and normalization

<br />

## API Design
- REST, GraphQL, or gRPC
- Endpoint definitions
- Request/response formats
