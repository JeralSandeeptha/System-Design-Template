# Server Traffic

Traffic of a web app means the amount of activity or usage the web application receives from users over the internet.

In simple terms, it answers the question: `“How many people are using the web app, and how often?”`

<br />

### Common ways traffic is measured
- `Visitors / Users` – how many people access the web app
- `Sessions` – how many times users visit
- `Page views` – how many pages/screens are loaded
- `Requests` – how many HTTP requests hit the server (important for backend load)
- `Bandwidth usage` – how much data is transferred
- `Concurrent users` – how many users are active at the same time

<br />

### Why traffic matters
- `Performance`: High traffic can slow the app if it’s not optimized
- `Scaling`: Helps decide when to add servers or use cloud scaling
- `Cost`: More traffic usually means higher hosting and bandwidth costs
- `Business insight`: Shows popularity, growth, and user engagement
