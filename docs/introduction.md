# What is Software System Designing

<br />

## What is Software System Design?
- Software system design is the process of defining `architecture`, `capacity planning`, `components`, `modules`, `interfaces`, and `data` for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's like creating a blueprint before constructing a building.

<br />

## Key Design Concepts

### Architecture Patterns
- `Monolithic`: All components in one codebase
- `Microservices`: Independent, loosely coupled services
- `Layered`: Separation of concerns (Presentation, Business, Data layers)
- `Event-Driven`: Components communicate via events
- `Serverless`: Cloud functions triggered by events

### Design Patterns
- `Creational`: Factory, Singleton, Builder
- `Structural`: Adapter, Decorator, Proxy
- `Behavioral`: Observer, Strategy, Command
