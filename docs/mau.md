# Monthly Active Users

`MAU` = Unique users active at least once in 30 days

<br />

### Why MAU matters
- Shows long-term adoption
- Used by investors & product teams
- Helps understand retention

<br />

### Design Implications:
- `Stickiness Metric`: DAU/MAU ratio indicates engagement quality
    - 20-30%: Good for consumer apps
    - 50%+: Excellent (like social networks)
    - `Stickiness = (DAU / MAU) × 100%`
- `Monthly Cycles`: Accounting cycles, pay periods affect usage
- `Retention Analysis`: MAU trends show long-term health

<br />

### Example
- MAU = 600,000
- DAU = 120,000

```cmd
120k / 600k = 20% → healthy product
```
